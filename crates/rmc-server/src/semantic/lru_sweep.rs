//! What an LRU capacity costs, measured at both ends.
//!
//! The track that ends here named its lever with numbers: `EditionedFileId::parse`
//! (capacity 128) and `MacroCallId::parse_macro_expansion` (1024) hold 5.5 GB of
//! the 7.1 GB the memory breakdown can see on this workspace. The knob for both
//! is a single number — `RA_LRU_CAP`, which `load_workspace` reads and hands to
//! `RootDatabase::new`, which spreads it as parse = N, macro expansion = 4N, ast
//! id maps = 8N (see `update_base_query_lru_capacities` in the fork).
//!
//! Turning that number down hands memory back and makes the next query rebuild
//! what was thrown away. Neither half is an argument on its own — "it saved two
//! gigabytes" says nothing without "and every query after it re-parsed the
//! workspace" — so this module measures both against the same probe on the same
//! database:
//!
//! * **memory**, as the heap the instrumented queries report before and after a
//!   collection. That is the only allocator-independent signal available: RSS
//!   cannot serve as the oracle, because glibc need not return freed pages, and
//!   the memo *count* cannot either, because evicting a memo blanks its value
//!   and keeps the slot;
//! * **latency**, as the wall time of repeating the probe once the eviction has
//!   happened, beside the time of repeating it again with everything back in
//!   cache. The gap between those two is what the capacity charges per query.
//!
//! # What this measures, and what it does not
//!
//! A steady state, not a peak. Production applies the capacity at load time, so
//! a small capacity there also caps the high-water mark while the workspace is
//! being read; here the database is loaded first and retuned afterwards. The
//! bytes a capacity holds *at rest* are the same either way; the peak is not,
//! and this cannot see it.
//!
//! The capacity is applied through the same call production makes —
//! `update_base_query_lru_capacities(Some(n))`, which is literally what
//! `RootDatabase::new` does with `RA_LRU_CAP` — rather than through a map
//! assembled here, so that what is priced is the knob that would be turned.
//!
//! # Two traps, both found by these tests failing
//!
//! `capacity == 0` **disables** eviction: an unbounded cache, not an empty one.
//! `1` is the smallest cache that still evicts. That sentence is a test below,
//! because it is the one mistake that would make a whole sweep read backwards.
//!
//! Worse, zero does not merely stop evicting — it **forgets the use order**.
//! `Lru::set_capacity(0)` drops the tracking set, and `record_use` records
//! nothing while the capacity is none (salsa's `function/eviction/lru.rs`), so
//! restoring a capacity afterwards does not restore eviction: until fresh
//! queries have recorded uses again, there is nothing to evict and a collection
//! hands back nothing. A sweep that walked capacities on one database without
//! knowing this measured a knob that had quietly turned itself off — which is
//! how the first run of these tests failed.
//!
//! That damage outlives the row it happens in: every capacity priced after a
//! zero can only evict what has been *used since*, which on this workload is
//! almost nothing (see the cost end below), so those rows read as "the knob
//! stopped working". A sweep therefore refuses a zero in its list — see
//! [`sweep_capacities`] — and the zero case is measured on its own instead.
//!
//! # Where the cost actually falls
//!
//! Not on repeats, which is where this module first looked for it. Measured:
//! evicting 12.2 MB of parse trees down to one and then repeating the very same
//! reference search costs *nothing* and brings *nothing* back — both read paths
//! of this daemon are answered out of memos above the parse query, and
//! re-validating those against unchanged files never asks for a tree again. What
//! pays is a **change**: after one edited file, 0.77 MB of the 12.2 came back.
//! So a smaller parse capacity charges the daemon on the queries that follow an
//! edit, and only for what the edit invalidated.
