    /// # Why the assertion is about CPU nodes and not about a ratio
    /// MIGraphX does not 'take nodes one by one': it cuts out a subgraph, compiles it
    /// and substitutes ONE fused node. Measured on this scene: a healthy
    /// GPU path gives `MIGraphXExecutionProvider=1` and zero CPU nodes, whereas
    /// the same corpus on the CPU profile gives 365 nodes (see the positive control below).
    /// So a ratio does not work as a metric here: a single unit 'weighs' the whole
    /// graph. We assert two properties: the fused node EXISTS, and the CPU has not accumulated
    /// a noticeable tail — i.e. the subgraph was not nibbled away piece by piece.
    ///
    /// The slack of 32 nodes is not a measured value but a margin: shape operators
    /// (Shape/Reshape/Cast) may in principle stay outside the subgraph, as
    /// seen on the python side with the ROCm EP (4158 nodes on GPU and 48 on CPU there — but
    /// the ROCm EP does not fuse, and its node picture is different). It is an order of magnitude
    /// below 365, so a 'graph went back to CPU' regression is caught with margin to spare.
