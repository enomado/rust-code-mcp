//! Single source of truth for "which `*.rs` files belong to a project".
//!
//! Before this module there were TWO independent walkers with different
//! answers: the indexer skipped build/VCS/generated directories
//! (`unified_parallel::collect_rust_files`), while the Merkle tree hashed
//! literally every `*.rs` under the root (`FileSystemMerkle::from_directory`).
//! On `rust_app` that gap was 621 files out of 3067 — a fifth of the tree
//! that the change detector tracked and the indexer never touched.
//!
//! The gap is not just wasted hashing: it makes the two sides
//! incomparable, so "is the index complete?" cannot be answered by
//! putting Merkle's file set next to the indexed one. Coverage checking
//! (see `monitoring::health`) needs both sides to mean the same thing,
//! hence one walker used by both.
//!
//! The same argument governs nested project roots (see [`NESTED_ROOT_MARKER`]):
//! the boundary is drawn INSIDE the shared walker precisely so that a subtree
//! leaves the index, the change detector and the staleness check at once.
//! Drawing it at one call site only would recreate the very gap this module
//! was written to close.
